Research Notes: Vector Databases
Date: 2024-03-22

Today I researched vector databases for our RAG implementation. These are crucial for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces. Here's what I learned:

Tried out several options:

1. ChromaDB
   - Easiest to get started with
   - Good Python API
   - Can run locally or in-memory
   - Perfect for prototyping
   - Decided to use this for initial implementation

2. Pinecone
   - Cloud-based solution
   - Great for production
   - Expensive for our scale
   - Might consider later if we need to scale

3. Weaviate
   - More complex but powerful
   - Good for multi-modal data
   - Overkill for our needs
   - Might revisit if we add images later

4. Milvus
   - Very performant
   - Complex setup
   - Good for large-scale deployments
   - Not needed for our current scale

Important concepts I need to understand better:
- HNSW index: Seems to be the best balance of speed and accuracy
- IVF index: Good for large datasets but less accurate
- Product Quantization: Helps with memory usage
- Cosine similarity vs Euclidean distance: When to use which?

Performance considerations:
- Query latency is crucial for good UX
- Memory usage can be high with large datasets
- Need to monitor index build time
- Should implement proper caching

Implementation plan:
1. Start with ChromaDB
2. Use HNSW index
3. Implement proper chunking
4. Add monitoring
5. Consider caching layer

Questions to research:
- How to handle updates to the knowledge base?
- What's the best way to implement versioning?
- How to handle failed queries gracefully?
- What metrics should we track?
