Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture

Overview:
RAG combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve language model outputs by incorporating external knowledge.

Core Components:

1. Retriever
- Dense Retrieval: Uses embeddings to find relevant documents
- Sparse Retrieval: Uses traditional IR methods (BM25, TF-IDF)
- Hybrid Retrieval: Combines both approaches

2. Generator
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Context-aware generation
- Factual consistency

3. Knowledge Base
- Document storage
- Vector database
- Indexing mechanisms

Implementation Steps:
1. Document Processing
   - Chunking
   - Embedding generation
   - Indexing

2. Query Processing
   - Query understanding
   - Retrieval
   - Context assembly

3. Generation
   - Context integration
   - Response generation
   - Fact verification

Advantages:
- Reduced hallucinations
- Up-to-date information
- Source attribution
- Cost-effective

Challenges:
- Retrieval quality
- Context window limitations
- Computational overhead
- Knowledge base maintenance

Research Notes: RAG Architecture
Date: 2024-03-21

Spent today understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, focusing on using Llama with Ollama for local deployment. It's fascinating how we can combine traditional information retrieval with local LLMs to create more factual and up-to-date responses.

My understanding:
- RAG was introduced in a 2020 paper by Lewis et al.
- The main idea is to use a retriever to find relevant documents and then use them to augment the LLM's response
- This helps reduce hallucinations and allows the model to access up-to-date information
- Using Ollama gives us full control and no API costs

Components I need to implement:
1. Retriever
   - Using Sentence Transformers for embeddings
   - ChromaDB for vector storage
   - Need to implement proper chunking strategy
   - Should consider hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings)

2. Generator (Llama via Ollama)
   - Using Llama-2-7b for generation
   - Need to figure out best way to incorporate retrieved context
   - Should experiment with different prompting strategies
   - Need to handle context window limitations
   - Must implement proper error handling for Ollama

3. Knowledge Base
   - Vector database for storing embeddings
   - Need to implement proper chunking strategy
   - Should consider metadata storage for better retrieval
   - Need to handle document updates efficiently

Implementation challenges I've identified:
- How to handle long documents effectively?
- What's the best chunking strategy?
- How to ensure retrieved context is actually relevant?
- How to handle conflicting information from different sources?
- How to optimize GPU memory usage?
- How to handle Ollama API errors and retries?

Experiments to try:
1. Compare different Llama models (7b vs 13b)
2. Test various chunking strategies
3. Evaluate different retrieval methods
4. Measure impact of context length on response quality
5. Profile memory usage and optimize

Next steps:
- Set up basic RAG pipeline with Ollama
- Implement document processing pipeline
- Create evaluation framework
- Start with simple retrieval methods and iterate
- Set up proper error handling and monitoring
