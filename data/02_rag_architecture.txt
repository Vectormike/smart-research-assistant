Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Architecture

Overview:
RAG combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve language model outputs by incorporating external knowledge.

Core Components:

1. Retriever
- Dense Retrieval: Uses embeddings to find relevant documents
- Sparse Retrieval: Uses traditional IR methods (BM25, TF-IDF)
- Hybrid Retrieval: Combines both approaches

2. Generator
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Context-aware generation
- Factual consistency

3. Knowledge Base
- Document storage
- Vector database
- Indexing mechanisms

Implementation Steps:
1. Document Processing
   - Chunking
   - Embedding generation
   - Indexing

2. Query Processing
   - Query understanding
   - Retrieval
   - Context assembly

3. Generation
   - Context integration
   - Response generation
   - Fact verification

Advantages:
- Reduced hallucinations
- Up-to-date information
- Source attribution
- Cost-effective

Challenges:
- Retrieval quality
- Context window limitations
- Computational overhead
- Knowledge base maintenance
